Version 6.0

MAJOR NEW FEATURES

1)  Option to use OpenBUGS or WinBUGS as the computing engine.
2)  Unstructured covariance model added to longitudinal option.
3)  Ability to edit the default generated initial values or use a previously saved state.
4)  Posterior plotting tool now also produces plots based on predictions or contrasts.
5)  More options when defining predictions & contrasts: v() notation for range of values, * can be used in all models,
    ~ handled better in contrast line, and better labels and information with output.


MINOR NEW FEATURES

1)  Auto Data button infers data range from currently active cell.
2)  Model Checks button now highlights when model checking options selected.
3)  Summary stats mean and SD annotated with comments to aid initial interpretation & assess adequacy of MCMC run length.
4)  Altered how zero constrained effects coded.  Set to zero exactly, fixing OpenBUGS issue with previous method.
5)  Reduced range of initial values when multiple chains used for links other than the identity.
6)  Better default priors for models with non-identity link, particularly when probabilities are being modelled.
7)  New default MCMC settings based on rules of thumb around sufficient accuracy of 95% credible limits.
8)  Various improvements to the help text.


BUG FIXES

1)  Error in determining time factor level for AR1e models with replicates at same unit/time.
2)  Error in BGX R Functions.R; used to return BRUGS simulated values with interpretable names.
3)  Error when saving MVt prior distribution parameters for exchangeable "random" coefficients
4)  Error when checking validity of contrast statement
5)  Main form locked whilst BUGS running to prevent further events being triggered.
6)  Error when NL model covariate given default setting when predictions set.
7)  Better handling of case when more than 250 variables being imported (truncates).
